# Instructions
Extract either pack to %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures\

The GM5E7D Folder should be located directly under the Textures folder to work correctly.

There's two packs and a patch in the Google Drive folder. The original pack is the first one I made, upscaled with UniScale. The second pack is made with UltraSharp. It's significantly cleaner and deblurred a lot of the textures. The patch is a basic fix for v2, it fixes the level icons and a console.

They both have different visual styles, use whichever one appears best to you. The original pack is more faithful to the original game, and the new pack is the cleanest upscale objectively.

To apply the patch, download and extract the V2 pack, then extract the patch over it and overwrite any files.

Some other models were used throughout the development of this pack. Including: BC1Smooth, UniversalUpscaler_Detailed, ArtClarity, 4x-UltraSharp, UniScale-Restore, NMKD UltraYandere, Ground, Remacri, and Misc.
